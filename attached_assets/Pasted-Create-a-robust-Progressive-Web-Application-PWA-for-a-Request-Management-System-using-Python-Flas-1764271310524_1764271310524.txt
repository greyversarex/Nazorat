Create a robust Progressive Web Application (PWA) for a Request Management System using Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap 5 for a mobile-first UI. The interface language must be Tajik.

### 1. Project Structure & Deployment Strategy
- The app will be deployed to a VPS via GitHub.
- **CRITICAL:** Create a `.gitignore` file immediately. It MUST exclude the SQLite database file (e.g., `instance/site.db`) and the media upload folder (`static/uploads`). This is to ensure that pushing code updates from Replit to GitHub does NOT overwrite the live database or user files on the production server.
- Ensure the app is structured clearly: separate routes for auth, admin, and user.

### 2. User Roles & Authentication
- **Roles:** 'Admin' and 'User'.
- **Login:** A single login page (`/login`) for everyone.
  - If role is 'Admin' -> Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`.
  - If role is 'User' -> Redirect to `/user/dashboard`.
- **Security:** Use proper password hashing (bcrypt) and Flask-Login for session management.

### 3. Database Models
- **User:** id, username, password_hash, role, created_at.
- **Topic:** id, title (created by Admin).
- **Request (Ticket):** id, user_id, topic_id, latitude, longitude, comment, media_filename (photo/video), status, created_at.
  - Statuses: 'new' (Нав), 'in_progress' (Дар баррасӣ), 'completed' (Иҷро шуд), 'rejected' (Рад шуд).

### 4. Admin Functionality
- **Topic Management:** Create/Edit/Delete topics (e.g., "Electricity", "Roads", "Water").
- **Dashboard:**
  - List of all requests sorted by date (newest first).
  - Filter requests by 'Topic'.
  - **Map View:** Integrate **Leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap)**. Show a button "View Map" for each request that opens a modal showing the exact location marker based on lat/long.
  - **Action:** Admin can change the status of the request (using a dropdown).

### 5. User Functionality
- **Dashboard:** View list of own submitted requests with their current status.
- **Create Request (The Core Feature):**
  - **Step 1:** Select 'Topic' (Dropdown from DB).
  - **Step 2:** Button "Муайян кардани ҷойгиршавӣ" (Get Location). Use JS Geolocation API. When clicked, capture lat/long into hidden inputs and show a checkmark or text confirming location is found.
  - **Step 3:** Text area for comments.
  - **Step 4:** File input for Photo/Video (validate extensions).
  - **Step 5:** Submit button.

### 6. Localization (Tajik Language)
Use these translations for the UI:
- App Name: "Systemi Darkhostho"
- Login: "Воридшавӣ"
- Username: "Номи корбар"
- Password: "Рамз"
- Submit/Send: "Равон кардан"
- Topic: "Мавзӯъ"
- Comment: "Шарҳ / Тавсиф"
- Get Location: "Муайян кардани ҷойгиршавӣ"
- Status: "Ҳолат"
- New: "Нав"
- In Progress: "Дар баррасӣ"
- Completed: "Иҷро шуд"
- Admin Panel: "Панели Админ"
- My Requests: "Дархостҳои ман"

### 7. PWA Features
- Add a `manifest.json` and a simple Service Worker so the website can be installed on Android/iOS as an app.
- Make the design responsive and touch-friendly (large buttons, clean inputs).
